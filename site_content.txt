==================

1. GENERAL INFO
------------------
Name: Ovelo
Tagline: "See how your day felt, not just what you did."
One-Sentence Summary: Ovelo is a privacy-first desktop app that reads the body language of your workday — app switches, typing cadence, mouse stillness, idle patterns — and turns it into a simple Day Trace and reflection so you can finally see how your attention actually lived through the day, not just what you got done.

Value Proposition:
- Behavioral rhythm instead of time tracking.
- Reflection instead of judgment.
- Privacy instead of surveillance.
- Emotional truth instead of productivity guilt.

2. KEY FEATURES
------------------
A. The Day Trace
   - A visual "focus ribbon" representing your day's attention flow.
   - Shows "Focus Peaks" (steady engagement), "Drift Zones" (fragmented attention), and "Recovery Points" (getting back on track).
   - Uses data like mouse stillness, typing rhythm, and app switching frequency.

B. AI Reflection
   - A daily narrative generated by AI (running locally or via API).
   - Describes how your day felt (e.g., "You had a strong morning but drifted after lunch...").
   - Offers one actionable suggestion for tomorrow.

C. Privacy First
   - Content-Blind: No screenshots, keystroke logging, or URL tracking.
   - Local-First: Data stays on your device.
   - Transparent: "What Ovelo Knows" panel shows exactly what is being tracked.

D. Ovelo Passport (Shareable Summary)
   - A highly visual, shareable "focus passport" for social media.
   - Visualizes your "Attention Orbit" and stats like Deep Focus Hours, Drift Weather, and Focus Styles.

4. FAQ SECTION
------------------
Q: Is Ovelo a time tracker?
A: No. Ovelo tracks the *rhythm* and *quality* of your attention, not just the hours you log. It doesn't care if you're on YouTube or Excel; it cares if you are focused or drifting.

Q: Does Ovelo record my screen or keystrokes?
A: No. Ovelo is "content-blind". It measures *how* you type (rhythm, speed) and *how* you move the mouse, but never *what* you type or *what* you are looking at. No screenshots, no keylogging.

Q: Where is my data stored?
A: Your data is stored locally on your computer.

Q: How does the "Day Trace" work?
A: Ovelo aggregates behavioral signals (mouse movement, typing bursts, app switching) into a continuous timeline. Stable patterns create "Focus Peaks," while erratic patterns create "Drift Zones."

Q: What is the AI Reflection?
A: At the end of the day, Ovelo sends anonymous, numerical summary data (e.g., "high switching in the afternoon") to an AI model to generate a short, human-like summary of your day's focus.

Q: Can I share my progress?
A: Yes! You can generate an "Ovelo Passport," a beautiful image summarizing your focus stats to share on social media.
